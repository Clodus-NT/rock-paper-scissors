This very basic game of rock-paper-scissors is meant to be played in the browser console. The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with basic Javascript as well as to learn how to problem solve.

By the end of this project, I hope to have a better understanding of how to "think like a programmer" and how to problem solve efficiently.
